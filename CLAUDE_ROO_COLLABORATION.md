## Collaboration Commands

### Claude Code Preparation Commands
```bash
# Status check for Roo Code
npm run dev                    # Start development server
npm run test:unit              # Verify tests pass
npm run lint                   # Check code quality
npm run type-check             # Verify TypeScript types
git status                     # Check current changes
```

### Information for Roo Code Context
```typescript
// Current tech stack:
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- NextAuth.js for authentication  
- Prisma + Supabase for database
- MCP servers for AI enhancement
- Vitest + React Testing Library for testing

// Key directories:
- src/app/              # Next.js app router pages
- src/components/       # Reusable UI components  
- src/lib/             # Utilities and services
- src/lib/mcp/         # MCP service integration
- tests/               # Test files
```

## Communication Protocol

### When to Use Each Tool:

**Use Claude Code for:**
- "Run the test suite"
- "Deploy to production" 
- "Set up a new service"
- "Install dependencies"
- "Create documentation"
- "Analyze system architecture"

**Use Roo Code for:**
- "Fix this bug in the component"
- "Add a new feature to this file"
- "Optimize this function"
- "Help me write this component"
- "Debug this TypeScript error"
- "Refactor this code"

### Context Sharing:

**Claude Code provides to Roo Code:**
- System status and health
- Test results and coverage
- Architecture decisions
- Configuration details
- Deployment status

**Roo Code provides to Claude Code:**
- Code changes and new features
- Bug reports and fixes
- Implementation details
- Performance concerns
- Testing needs

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Handoffs
Always communicate what has been completed and what needs to be done next.

### 2. Maintain Documentation
Keep this collaboration guide and project documentation updated.

### 3. Use Git Effectively
```bash
# Claude Code: Create descriptive commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add MCP integration with Sequential Thinking and Magic UI"

# Roo Code: Work on feature branches for complex changes
git checkout -b feature/enhanced-chat-ui
```

### 4. Test Before Handoff
Always verify that the system is in a working state before handing off.

### 5. Share Context
Provide relevant information about current state, recent changes, and immediate goals.

## Current Development Priority

Based on the current state, here's what Roo Code should focus on next:

### High Priority:
1. **Chat Interface Enhancement**: Improve the MCP-enabled chat experience
2. **Rule Creation Flow**: Build intuitive rule creation components
3. **Dashboard Polish**: Enhance the main dashboard UI
4. **Error Handling**: Add better error states and loading indicators

### Medium Priority:
1. **Component Library**: Build reusable crypto-specific components
2. **Animation & Transitions**: Add smooth interactions
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimize for mobile devices
4. **Performance**: Optimize rendering and API calls

### Low Priority:
1. **Advanced Features**: Complex automation scenarios
2. **Analytics**: Detailed usage tracking
3. **Integrations**: Additional wallet providers
4. **Themes**: Dark/light mode variations

## Quick Start for Roo Code

1. **Open VS Code** in the project directory
2. **Start development server** (Claude Code has it running at http://localhost:3000)
3. **Check current status** in browser
4. **Begin development** on priority items above
5. **Use MCP features** by clicking the brain icon (ðŸ§ ) in chat

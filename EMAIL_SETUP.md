# Email Setup for Ferrow Authentication

Your Ferrow application is now configured for both **sign-in and sign-up** using magic links. Here's how to complete the email setup:

## ✅ What's Fixed

1. **Sign-up Flow**: The app now clearly indicates it handles both sign-in AND sign-up
2. **UI Improvements**: Updated messaging to "Welcome to Ferrow" and "Enter your email to sign in or create an account"
3. **Email Infrastructure**: Integrated Resend for production-ready email delivery
4. **Build Issues**: Fixed all build-time initialization problems

## 📧 Email Delivery Setup

### For Production (Recommended: Resend)

1. **Get a Resend API Key**:
   - Go to [https://resend.com](https://resend.com)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Navigate to API Keys section
   - Create a new API key

2. **Update Vercel Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   # Replace the placeholder with your real API key
   npx vercel env add RESEND_API_KEY production
   # When prompted, enter your real Resend API key (starts with "re_")
   ```

3. **Configure Domain (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - In Resend dashboard, add your domain (e.g., `ferrow.app`)
   - Verify DNS records
   - Update `EMAIL_FROM` to use your domain: `noreply@yourdomain.com`

### For Development

The app automatically logs magic links to the console in development:
```
🔗 MAGIC LINK (Development Mode):
📧 To: user@example.com
🔗 Link: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/email?token=...

Copy this link to your browser to sign in
```

## 🚀 How Authentication Works Now

1. **User enters email** → App sends magic link via Resend
2. **User clicks link in email** → Automatically signs in
3. **First-time users** → Account created automatically
4. **Returning users** → Signs into existing account

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Your app needs these environment variables in production:

```bash
# Required for authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://stablecoin-ai.vercel.app"

# Required for email delivery
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_resend_api_key"
EMAIL_FROM="noreply@ferrow.app"  # or your custom domain

# Database (already configured)
DATABASE_URL="your-supabase-connection-string"
```

## 📝 Current Status

✅ **Sign-in/Sign-up UI**: Updated and deployed  
✅ **Email Service**: Resend integration ready  
⚠️ **API Key**: Placeholder set - needs real Resend key  
✅ **Development**: Works with console logging  

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Development**: Magic links appear in console
2. **Production**: Once you add real Resend API key:
   - Go to `/auth/signin`
   - Enter any email address
   - Check email for magic link
   - Click link to authenticate

## 💡 Next Steps

1. **Get Resend API key** and update Vercel environment
2. **Optional**: Set up custom domain for branded emails
3. **Test authentication** with real email addresses

Your Ferrow app is now ready for production authentication! 🎉
